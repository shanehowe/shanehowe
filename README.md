I'm Shane, a Computer Science student at Munster Technological University. I’m passionate about building innovative software and constantly learning new technologies.

### Experience

I've worked as a Software Engineer Intern at **Microsoft** and **Fexco**, where I gained experience working across the entire stack — from crafting front-end interfaces to building and maintaining back-end services. I also developed skills in writing unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

### Skills

I'm skilled in **Java, Python, TypeScript, SQL, MongoDB, FastAPI, React, and Spring Boot**, which you'll see reflected in my repositories. I enjoy exploring new frameworks and tools and applying them to real-world projects.
